Deque impelements the following methods:

#####removeFirst
#####removeLast
#####addFirst
#####addLast
#####peekFirst
#####peekLast
#####isEmpty

These are the same methods needed to implement a Queue, but Deque includes methods that allow the user to peek at, add to, or remove from both the front and end of the list.
